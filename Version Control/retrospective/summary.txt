SOLVING MERGE CONFLICT

The merge conflict between the two branches Test and Working was solved by first removing the three 
merge conflict markers in the README.md file:
- <<<<< HEAD (Current Change)
- =====
- >>>>> Test (Incoming Change)

Because I wished to keep both changes, I left both the student id number and the git version number on separate lines.
I then staged the resolved file using the `git add` command and committed it with the git commit command and a message 
that the two changes are merged. I then pushed the merged Working branch to the remote repository.


THE THREE CHANGES TO THREE HTML FILES IN THE WORKING BRANCH
- The first change I made was to change the header in the index.html file from "Western Tech Hub" to "Eastern Tech Hub". I then staged and committed this change.
- Next I corrected spelling errors in the team.html file, which I then staged and committed. 
- Lastly I corrected spelling errors in the about.html file, which I also staged and committed. 
After the three changes had been committed, I pushed the branch to the remote repo using the `git push origin` command.
